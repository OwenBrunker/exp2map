# exp2map
This parser takes the mangled portion of a procedure export string and converts it to a queue of data type parameters.

The assumption is that the procedure name has already been extracted out and only the portion of the string after
the @F is passed through to the parser.

When the program is executed, a window displays an entry box and a listbox.  Enter a value into the entry box and press the parse button.

Example of parsing an EXP line with many types:
